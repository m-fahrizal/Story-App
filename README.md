# Story-App
Creating an android application that can create stories and can display a list of stories that have been created by all users using the API from Dicoding using Paging 3. There are also maps that refer to the user's location when adding stories. In addition, it also applies Unit Testing to the function in the ViewModel that retrieves the Paging data list.
